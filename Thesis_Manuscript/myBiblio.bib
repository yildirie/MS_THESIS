   abstract = {This book provides a complete analysis of those subjects that are of fundamental importance to the qualitative theory of differential equations and related to current research—including details that other books in the field tend to overlook. Chapters 1—7 cover the basic qualitative properties concerning existence and uniqueness, structures of solutions, phase portraits, stability, bifurcation and chaos. Chapters 8—12 cover stability, dynamical systems, and bounded and periodic solutions. A good reference book for teachers, researchers, and other professionals.}

  abstract = {The basic reproduction ratio and its computation formulae are established for a large class of compartmental epidemic models in periodic environments. It is proved that a disease cannot invade the disease-free state if the ratio is less than unity and can invade if it is greater than unity. It is also shown that the basic reproduction number of the time-averaged autonomous system is applicable in the case where both the matrix of new infection rate and the matrix of transition and dissipation within infectious compartments are diagonal, but it may underestimate and overestimate infection risks in other cases. The global dynamics of a periodic epidemic model with patch structure is analyzed in order to study the impact of periodic contacts or periodic migrations on the disease transmission.}
