\section{Study Area and Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:area_and_data}

 The study area is located on the Gulf of Aqaba cost in Saudi Arabia (\figref{fig:golf_aqaba}). An earthquake along the Dead Sea strike-slip fault with a magnitude of 7.3, which  happened in 1995~\cite{krhm:99}, was affected the area by causing surface raptures that might be parts of the primary faulting system~\cite{ahas:96}. Geophysical investigations across one of these surface raptures (\figref{fig:location}) to locate and characterize the faults in subsurface were previously conducted~\cite{hjk:14}.  As for the seismic prospecting, 2D refraction data were collected along the survey line.  A total of 120 common shot gathers with a regular source shift of 2.5 m was performed. For each shot, there were 120 traces at the receivers which were also deployed in a 2.5 m regular intervals. Seismic data were recorded with a 1 ms sampling interval for a total recording time of 0.5 s. An example of a shot gather and corresponding first arrivals is shown in \figref{fig:shot_gather_fa}.
